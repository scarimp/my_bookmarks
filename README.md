**Google Cloud Natural vs. gensim vs. Amazon Comprehend vs. NLU vs. MonkeyLearn vs. Semantria**

It comes with pre-trained statistical models and word vectors, 
and currently supports tokenization for 49+ languages.

# rasa NLU

rasa NLU (Natural Language Understanding) is a tool for intent classification and entity extraction. 
You can think of rasa NLU as a set of high level APIs for building your own language 
parser using existing NLP and ML libraries.


# Google Cloud Natural Language API.
You can use it to extract information about people, places, events and much more, 
mentioned in text documents, news articles or blog posts. You can use it to 
understand sentiment about your product on social media or parse intent from 
customer conversations happening in a call center or a messaging app. 
You can analyze text uploaded in your request or integrate with your 
document storage on Google Cloud Storage.

# Amazon Comprehend

Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning 
to discover insights from text. Amazon Comprehend provides Keyphrase Extraction, 
Sentiment Analysis, Entity Recognition, Topic Modeling, and Language 
Detection APIs so you can easily integrate natural language processing 
into your applications.

# Gensim
It is a Python library for topic modelling, document i
ndexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora. 
Target audience is the natural 
language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) community.

Big data e deep learning: un nuovo modello matematico per creare sistemi artificiali intelligenti.

Un gruppo tutto italiano di ricercatori ha messo a punto una nuova teoria che apre la strada allo studio delle “macchine matematiche” pensate per risolvere problemi complessi grazie all'analisi dei dati

    Do you ever wonder how lawyers effectively manage series of court statements. How do they get around the general context of     a legal document in order to figure what to look-out for before eventually having to take it up. Seems pretty easy until one has a 3000 paged document with salient details. This was the motivation behind this project, to automatically model topics from a pdf of legal documents and **summarize** the key contexts.
